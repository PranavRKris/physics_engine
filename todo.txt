🔁 1. Elastic & Inelastic Collisions
Bouncing balls in 1D or 2D

Show conservation of momentum & energy

Add mass sliders and velocity vectors

Concepts:
momentum, coefficient of restitution, kinetic energy

🎢 2. Projectile Motion
Launch objects at an angle with adjustable velocity

Show trajectory, max height, time of flight

Add-ons:
Wind resistance, different gravity per planet

🪢 3. Pendulum & Double Pendulum
Single pendulum: show periodic motion

Double pendulum: chaotic motion (great for visuals!)

Concepts:
harmonic motion, chaos, torque

📦 4. Spring-Mass System
Block on a spring oscillating horizontally or vertically

Adjustable stiffness, damping, mass

Concepts:
Hooke's Law, damping, resonance

🌊 5. Wave Simulation
1D transverse waves: string oscillation

Interference patterns or standing waves

Advanced: Use Fourier components

🧲 6. Electric Fields & Charges
Visualize field lines from positive/negative charges

Show forces on test charges in real time

🔲 7. Rigid Body Physics
Stack or tumble 2D shapes (requires collision detection)

Simulate torque, rotation, friction

🔁 8. Circular Motion
Object rotating around a center

Show centripetal force, angular velocity

🛰️ 9. Orbital Mechanics
Simulate satellites around planets

Show stable orbits vs escape trajectory

🧱 10. Gravity with Multiple Bodies (N-body simulation)
Add 2+ planets or moons, simulate gravitational pull between all

Great to show orbital instability and complexity
